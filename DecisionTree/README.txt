# DecisionTree
This program looks at the mushroom_data.txt and the attributes.txt and creates a decision tree.

## Compiling and Running
Using standard javac the program can be ran with commandline arguments for the class Driver

## Known Issues
The actually branching and splitting of nodes doesn't work quite correctly. 
I'm not sure why, but I am currently working on figuring it out.
Once that works, everything else should run smoothly.
